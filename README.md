A work in progress, mainly to get my head around git and brush up on my javascript.

Built using Phaser 3.

In order to build it yourself make sure you have vscode with "Preview on web server" installed. Extensions.json should recommend you to install it.
To "Build" simply click in index.html and press Ctrl-Shift-L. It should open up a brower window to test it.
